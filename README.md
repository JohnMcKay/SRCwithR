# Sparse Reconstruction-Based Classification Using R (and a Spike and Slab Prior)
An implementation of sparse reconstruction-based classification (using Spike and Slab prior) with R
This was created for a course at Penn State (Regression, STAT 501) so it should give a nice overview.

To use this, first - in your fav language - obtain a dictionary of images (a matrix whose columns are
the training images for your classifier - don't forget to normalize these columns!) and save it as a
csv file.  Do the same for the labels (numeric) for each respective column.  With there, make sure
packages are loaded, paths are correct, etc.  You can use R to create the dictionaries and labels but
it's not fun (I used Matlab originally).

Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I definitely have some small comments to help anyone if
so needed.
