# Sparse Reconstruction-Based Classification Using R (and a Spike and Slab Prior)
An implementation of sparse reconstruction-based classification (using Spike and Slab prior) with R
This was created for a course at Penn State (Regression, STAT 501) so it should give a nice overview.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.  I definitely have some small comments to help anyone if
so needed.
